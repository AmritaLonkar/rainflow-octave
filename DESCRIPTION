Title: Rainflow count of stress cycles for fatigue analysis 
Description: This function identifies the stress cycles in an irregular 
 time series of stress. The rain flow algorithm code has been prepared 
 according to the ASTM standard "Standard practices for cycle counting 
 in fatigue analysis" and optimized considering the calculation time.
 This is the same algorithm as that described by de Jonge, J.B.(1982): 
 "The analysis of load-time histories by means of counting methods". 
 The results are exactly equal to those obtained by the algorithm described
 by Matsuiski, M. and Endo, T. (1969): "Fatigue of metals subjected to 
 varying stress".
