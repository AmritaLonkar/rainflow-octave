<H1>RAINFLOW COUNTING METHOD FOR GNU OCTAVE</H1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Adam Nies這ny prepared <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3026">a public rain flow count algorithm </a>
for the Matlab language back in 2005. This GNU Octave package has been prepared based on this work. 
Adam Nies這ny has specified the GNU GPLv3 license for the purpose of this GNU Octave package.

<h2>Description</h2>
This utility function provide the rainflow count algorithm that is typically used in fatigue analysis. It is typically used 
to extract stress-cycles that causes material fatigue.

<h2>An alert for the engineer calculating fatigue damage</h2>
The routines provide for each stress cycle, the following minimum information:
<ul>
  <li>the stress variation, the <u>amplitude</u></li>
  <li>the average stress value for the cycle</li>
  <li>the number of cycles (0.5 or 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>Observe that the stress range, the double amplitude, is usually 
applied in SN-curves when calculating the fatigue damage by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(material)#Miner.27s_rule">
Miner-Palmgren</a> method. You should normally do: <u>range = 2*amplitude</u></p>

<h2>Rainflow algorithm</h2>

<p>The algorithm used is the "range pair-range" algorithm as described
in ASTM E 1049-85 and by de Jonge (1982). The result from the "range
pair-range" algorithm is exactly similar to that of the pagoda-roof 
"rainflow" algorithm as described by Matsuiski, M. and  Endo, T. 
(1969). However, their descriptions are very different and the "range 
pair-range" algorithm is very much simpler to program. </p>

<h2>Author</h2>
The code was developed for Matlab by Dr. Adam Nieslonya. It
was originally released for Matlab, see <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3026">announcement.</a> 


<h2>Package for GNU Octave</h2>
Source code can be obtained at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rainflow-octave/">
http://code.google.com/p/rainflow-octave/</a>.<br>
GNU Octave specific issues should be addressed there.

<h2>Figures</h2>
<p> The following figures show an example rainflow matrix and stress cycles extracted from
a series of turning points.</p>

<h2>Compilation and installation for GNU Octave </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Do the following to create a compiled mex-file from "rainflow.c" and to test the result:<br>
    <code>
      $ cd ./rainflow-octave    <br>
      $ make                    <br>
      $ ls ./src/rainflow.mex   <br>
      rainflow.mex              <br> 
      $ make test               <br> 
    </code>
    <li>Move files: rainflow.mex, rainflow.m and sig2ext.m to a place where GNU Octave can find them.<br>
      Octave will locate oct- or mex- files automatically if they are in a
      directory listed in the search path. To figure out the search path, do:<br>
      <code>
      $ octave </br>
      octave>  path<br>
      </code>
      Octave's search path contain the following directories:<br>
      .<br>
      /usr/local/share/octave/site-m<br>
</ol>

<h2>Disclaimer for GNU Octave</h2>
The main focus for the GNU Octave package development has been on the primary functionality:
<ol>
  <li>The rainflow function.</li>
  <li>The function for extracting turning points from stress time series.</li>
  <li>Documentation and testing.</li>
  <li>Packaging.</li>
</ol>

<p>The auxilliary demonstration scripts are fully unmodified and have not been tested 
extensively. The script <em>rfdemo1.m</em> is suspected to contain a Matlab specific 
command associated with a button. The GNU Octave version 3.0.0 has been applied.</p>

<p>Version date: 12.01.2005</p>

<H2>Description</H2>

<p>Here you can find the rain flow algorithm for cycle counting,  adapted for work in the  MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> environment. It has been translated from Turbo Pascal into C language and compiled to the MEX function.  The algorithm code has been prepared according to the ASTM standard [1] and  optimized considering the calculation time. The function was tested with use of PC computers in the  MS Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> operating system.<br>
